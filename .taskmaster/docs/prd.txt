# Visual Daily Planner PRD

## 1. Overview
A web app for visually managing daily schedules by combining a timetable (hourly grid) and a circular (clock-style) time management UI. Users can add tasks, mark completion, write notes, and view motivational quotes. The app recommends activities by category and integrates with public APIs for real-time content (recipes, books, etc.).

## 2. Core Features
- **Timetable & Circular Time UI**: Visualize the day in both grid and clock formats. Users can interact with both to manage their schedule.
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and check off tasks for each time slot. Add notes and view motivational quotes per slot.
- **Category Recommendations**: Suggest activities for rest, hobbies, exercise, self-development, relationships, volunteering, etc. Special section for "What to do when you don't know what to do" at the bottom.
- **Motivational Quotes**: Display a daily quote at the top, in the calendar, and in each schedule slot. Quotes are fetched from an API or local DB.
- **API Content Integration**: Real-time recommendations for recipes, books, etc., using free public APIs. Each activity slot can show a "Today's Recipe" or "Today's Book" button.
- **Notifications & Reminders**: Digital time management tools for routine reminders, completion checks, and visual tools (timetable, circular chart, checklist) to boost adherence.
